# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview
We have been tasked with analyzing ride share data across multiple cities. We want to see if there are any distinguishing features of between our city types. The city types we will be looking at are Rural, Suburban and Urban. We will be using matplotlib and pandas to conduct our analysis.

## Results
When analyzing our data, we noticed several defining features of our cities. First, there were more drives and rides in Urban cities than anywhere else. Second, Rural cities had the lowest total fares but had the highest fare cost per ride, and driver. Third, Urban cities may have had the most in total fares but they had the lowest average cost per ride. We can assume that the high number of both rides and available drivers drove down the average cost per ride.

This information can be viewed in our summary data frame below.

We also notice a level of seasonality in the total fares per week for each type of city. Fare totals generally went up coming out of the winter months of 2019 and leading in the beginning of spring. We may want to see if this is because there is greater ridership as there are more events/activities to do outside. People may be going across town to see friends or go out to dinner.

This seasonality is visualized below.

## Summary
In conclusion, we have three recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparities in rides between communities. First, Rural communities are underserved. They may have a lower overall ridership but the people that do utilize the service are being charged nearly 5x as much as people in the city. To curtail this, we could look into creating incentives for people in Rural communities to become drivers. Such as starting bonuses for new drivers. Second, it is extremely difficult as a drive in the city to get consistent fares. There are just simply too many drivers for the number of riders. Drivers see fewer total rides and lower cost fares for the few rides that they do secure. We may want to look at incentivizing cross-community drivers. By incentivizing drivers who can operate in both a rural and urban communities we would be able to free up fares for other city drivers and lower cost for riders in rural communities. Lastly, there seems to be a spike in all communities during the last half of February. If this change is due to Valentineâ€™s Day and the increase of riders using our service to go on dates then maybe, we want to lean into this with our marketing campaigns. We should do more outreach to get people to use our service to go and have a special night with their significant other. We could potentially expend ridership by getting more people to use our services after their night on the town.
